"""The periodic loop (FR-401, FR-403, FR-327, FR-364, NFR-303).

Five recurring pieces of work, none of which belongs to a request:

============================  ==========  ==================================
task                          default     what it does
============================  ==========  ==================================
``watchlist``                 hourly      runs the watches that are due
                                          (FR-401); each watch's own
                                          interval decides which those are
``replies``                   15 minutes  classifies replies the mail slice
                                          has stored (FR-422)
``digest``                    6 hours     generates the digests that are
                                          due; each seeker gets one a week
                                          (FR-403)
``follow_ups``                hourly      notifies about follow-ups whose
                                          date has passed (FR-327)
``retention``                 daily       deletes third-party records past
                                          their retention date (NFR-303)
``llm_redaction``             daily       nulls prompt and response text
                                          past its retention (FR-364)
============================  ==========  ==================================

Two properties make this safe to run inside the API process:

*Nothing here sends anything.*  The scheduler classifies, drafts, notifies and
deletes.  Every outbound message still waits for the job seeker (NFR-305).

*Everything is idempotent and time-stamped.*  Each task records its last run
in ``app_setting``, so a restart does not re-run the day's work, and every
task's own writes are de-duplicated (a watch has ``next_check_at``, a
notification has ``dedup_key``, a digest has its period as a key).  A task
that raises is logged and retried on its next tick; one broken task never
stops the others.

Running it for real
-------------------

In development the loop lives in the API process.  :func:`maybe_autostart`
starts it from the application lifespan, controlled by
``DREAMJOB_SCHEDULER_ENABLED`` (default on) with
``DREAMJOB_SCHEDULER_AUTOSTART`` still honoured as an explicit override.  An
administrator can also start and stop it from ``POST
/api/monitoring/scheduler/start``.  It used to be reachable only from that API
call, so nothing ever ran.

For a real deployment on macOS, run the tasks from ``launchd`` instead, so
that they survive an API restart and appear in the system log::

    # ~/Library/LaunchAgents/net.stepvda.dreamjob.monitoring.plist
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <plist version="1.0"><dict>
      <key>Label</key><string>net.stepvda.dreamjob.monitoring</string>
      <key>ProgramArguments</key>
      <array>
        <string>/usr/bin/env</string>
        <string>PYTHONPATH=/opt/dreamjob/backend</string>
        <string>/opt/dreamjob/.venv/bin/python</string>
        <string>-m</string><string>dreamjob.monitoring.scheduler</string>
        <string>--once</string>
      </array>
      <key>StartInterval</key><integer>3600</integer>
      <key>StandardOutPath</key><string>/var/log/dreamjob-monitoring.log</string>
      <key>StandardErrorPath</key><string>/var/log/dreamjob-monitoring.log</string>
    </dict></plist>

then ``launchctl load -w`` that file.  The equivalent crontab line is::

    17 * * * * cd /opt/dreamjob && PYTHONPATH=backend .venv/bin/python \\
               -m dreamjob.monitoring.scheduler --once >> /var/log/dreamjob.log 2>&1

``--once`` runs every task whose interval has elapsed and exits, which is why
the same code serves both: the intervals live in the task table, not in the
scheduler that calls them, so cron firing hourly does not turn a daily sweep
into an hourly one.
