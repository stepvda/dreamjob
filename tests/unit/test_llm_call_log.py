"""A call that produced nothing is logged as having produced nothing (FR-364).

The AI call log is the only record of what the models were asked and what came
back, so its worst failure mode is not a missing row - it is a row that says a
call succeeded when the feature that made it got nothing.  That is exactly what
happened: a reasoning model can spend its whole ``max_tokens`` budget on its
private chain of thought and return a 200 with an empty ``content``, and the
call was written to the log as ``status='ok'`` with an empty response.

These tests hold the client to the honest version: the tokens were spent, so
the row is written, and it is written as ``truncated`` or ``empty`` with the
reason on it.
