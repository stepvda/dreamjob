"""Find the website behind a company we already know something about.

The company-enrichment ladder needs one thing before it can do anything: a URL
to read.  Without it the website rung cannot classify the employer, the
crawler has no page to fetch, and a company stays a name - so scoring, which
reads the summary, sector, size, stage and values the crawl produces, scores
it against nothing.  Measured on this installation: 57 of 66 employers behind
one seeker's opportunities had no ``domain``, and the enrichment reported
"profiled: 64" while storing almost nothing, because there was nothing to read.

Most of those companies are not actually unknown.  We hold a vacancy whose
``source_url`` is on the employer's own site, or an ATS board slug whose tenant
name is the employer's name.  This module turns that into a domain:

* **A vacancy URL on a real host** is the company's site already
  (``jobs.monizze.be`` -> ``monizze.be``).  No request needed.
* **An ATS board URL** names its tenant (``aikidosecurity.recruitee.com`` ->
  ``aikidosecurity``), and the tenant name is usually the company name, so the
  plausible top-level domains are probed and the first live one wins.
* **A stored ``source`` that is a URL** is used as-is.

Nothing is guessed into the knowledge base: a candidate is probed, and only a
host that answers is written.  A wrong domain is worse than a missing one - it
would profile somebody else's company under this one's name.
