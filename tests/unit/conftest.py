"""No unit test may touch the installed database (plan item C5).

Two rows named ``broken_board`` and ``stub_board`` sat in the installed
``source_catalogue`` for months and were selected as real sources by every
campaign, and fourteen more had joined them by the time anyone looked.  They
were not seeded by a migration or by an operator: they are stub adapters that
unit modules register in the process-wide adapter registry (NFR-601), and one
test class called ``load_all()`` without pointing the database anywhere, so
``sync_catalogue`` wrote every stub in the registry - including the ones other
modules had registered - into ``data/dreamjob.db``.

Individually each module was innocent; the leak only appeared when the whole
suite ran in one process, which is why it survived so long.  Rather than
asking every future test to remember the fixture, the whole unit suite is
pointed at a scratch database here, before any module fixture runs.  Modules
that want isolation still create their own ``tmp_path`` database on top of
this; ``monkeypatch`` then restores the scratch path rather than the installed
one when they are done.

    The same class of leak as the installed database above, through a
    different door.  Collection now ends in the passes that rank what it
    collected, and the last of those reaches for the model when one is
    configured (FR-281) - so on a machine with a real ``DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`` in
    its environment, tests that merely run a campaign to completion started
    making live, billed API calls.  Ten seconds of one test run was three
    HTTPS round trips to a paid endpoint.

    A unit test that wants to exercise model behaviour injects a fake client,
    as ``_CountingLLM`` and its like already do, so the credentials are simply
    absent for the whole session and every pass that looks for a model
    degrades to its deterministic path.

    The exception is deliberate and has to stay reachable: the prompt
    regression checks in ``test_employer_website_rung`` mean to call a real
    model and skip themselves when none is configured.  Setting
    ``DREAMJOB_TEST_ALLOW_MODEL=1`` lifts this guard for a run, which is how
