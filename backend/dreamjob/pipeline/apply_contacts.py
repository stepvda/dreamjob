"""Contacts at scale for the Apply Browser (FR-301, FR-303, FR-304, FR-305).

:mod:`dreamjob.pipeline.contacts` answers "who should I write to about *this*
opportunity" and is worth a site crawl, an LLM-shaped company structure and a
ranked list of eight candidates.  The Apply Browser asks a coarser question of
a thousand rows at once - *does this vacancy have anything to apply to at all?*
- and the expensive per-opportunity path cannot answer it inside a screen's
patience.  This module is that second question.  It reuses the first module's
vocabulary throughout: :class:`~dreamjob.pipeline.contacts.ContactCandidate`,
its ranking, its NFR-303 storage scope, :mod:`~dreamjob.pipeline.email_patterns`
for finding and inferring addresses and :mod:`~dreamjob.pipeline.email_validate`
for the verdict.  Nothing here re-implements them.

**The ladder (FR-301, FR-303), in the order the brief fixes:**

1. a contact the knowledge base already holds for the company (free, FR-341);
2. the vacancy's own ``application_target`` when it is an address - the
   employer's stated channel, free to read, and the strongest evidence there
   is (``email_source_method = 'vacancy'``);
3. an address published on the company's own website or press page
   (``website`` / ``press``);
4. pattern inference from the other addresses on that domain
   (``pattern_inference``);
5. a generic careers mailbox, and only then (``pattern_inference``, with
   ``is_generic_mailbox`` set).

**The step the brief does not name, and why it is here.**  Every one of steps
3 to 5 needs a *domain*, and when this module was written 1,151 of the 1,202
companies that had posted a vacancy had none - the fifty-one that did were the
end-to-end fixtures.  EURES and Arbeitnow publish an employer name and nothing
else, and the ``employer.website`` field of the EURES payload is null for all
4,692 postings we hold.  So a domain has to be resolved before the ladder can
run at all, and how that is done decides whether the addresses below it are
evidence or fiction:

* ``company``  - already on the company record.  Trusted.
* ``vacancy_text`` - the domain of an address the employer itself published in
  the posting.  Trusted; the employer wrote it.
* ``derived_confirmed`` - a domain spelled from the company name and then
  **confirmed**: it must resolve to a mail exchanger (FR-304), its home page
  must answer, and that page must name the company.  A candidate that only has
  MX is discarded.  This matters: on 300 companies, name-plus-MX alone accepts
  ``house.com`` for "HOUSE OF RECRUITMENT SOLUTIONS BV" and ``federale.be`` for
  a federal ministry - addresses that would have gone to a real person at an
  unrelated company.  Requiring the page to name the company is what makes the
  derivation evidence rather than a guess (CR-405).

**Never invent an address.**  A company whose ladder produces nothing is
written to ``apply_contact_resolution`` with ``status = 'unreachable'`` and the
reason, and the Apply Browser shows it as such.  That row is a finding: it is
what stops the interface from offering a "generate" button for a company nobody
can reach, and it is what stops the next pass from re-crawling it.

**FR-305 rate limiting and caching.**  Three caches, each keyed on the thing
that is expensive:

* ``apply_domain_probe`` - the confirm/reject verdict per domain, so a domain
  is derived and fetched once, not once per company that spells to it;
* ``email_domain_state`` - the MX answer per domain, through
  :func:`email_validate.mx_for`, which the validation slice already maintains;
* ``http_cache`` and ``robots_cache`` - pages and rules, through the egress
  client, which also enforces robots.txt and the per-domain rate limit
  (FR-182, CR-402).  Nothing here fetches over HTTP by any other route.

**FR-306 / RK-08.**  Every stored address goes through
``ContactCandidate.as_contact_row`` and ``repositories.contacts.minimise``, so
the columns are the FR-306 minimum and nothing else about a person is kept.
NFR-302 objections are honoured because the ladder reads ``usable_contact`` and
because ``upsert_contact`` refuses to refresh a blocked row.

The bulk pass runs FR-304 with ``allow_smtp=False`` by default: an SMTP probe
per address would be several thousand connections to other people's mail
servers for one screen, which is neither what FR-305 has in mind nor polite
(CR-402).  Offline verdicts are therefore ``risky`` or ``unknown``, never
``valid`` - which is the honest answer - and the per-opportunity path in
:mod:`dreamjob.pipeline.contacts` still probes when a job seeker is actually
about to write to somebody.

    ``scope='shortlist'`` (the default) is the original pass: ``limit`` counts
    *vacancies*, the work list is :func:`apply.companies_needing_contact`, and
    the pass stops as soon as ``limit`` vacancies have somebody to write to.
    Sixty companies can carry five hundred vacancies, so counting companies
    would either stop far too early or crawl hundreds of sites nobody needed.

    ``scope='all'`` widens the pool to every company in the knowledge base,
    including companies with no vacancy and no opportunity: ``limit`` counts
    *companies to visit*, the work list is
    :func:`apply.all_companies_for_contact` - every company that does not yet
    have a usable contact - and the pass visits every selected company without
    stopping early on vacancy coverage.  A company whose last verdict is
    younger than :data:`apply.ALL_COMPANIES_FRESHNESS_DAYS` is left alone, and
    the queue puts never-attempted companies first and the oldest attempts
    next, so a repeated sweep spends its budget on new companies instead of
    re-walking the ones it just walked.  ``refresh`` ignores that backoff and
    includes companies that already have a contact, so they are re-checked;
    ``max_companies`` caps the work list either way.

    ``order`` is ``vacancies`` by default because ``limit`` is: a target
    counted in vacancies is filled fastest by walking the companies that carry
    the most of them, and one site crawl that covers twenty-seven vacancies is
    twenty-seven times the coverage of one that covers a single posting for the
    same politeness budget (FR-305, CR-402).  ``recency`` is still there for a
    caller that wants the freshest corpus rather than the largest.

    In the ``shortlist`` scope, ``limit`` is a *target for the corpus*, not a
    quota for this call: the vacancies already covered are subtracted first, so
    calling this twice does not do the work twice, and calling it when the
    corpus is already there fetches nothing at all.  ``already_covered`` and
    ``shortfall`` on the report say which of the two happened; in the ``all``
    scope ``requested`` is the number of companies selected instead.

    Companies are resolved concurrently; the shared :class:`EgressClient` is
    what keeps that polite, since its per-domain rate limit and robots.txt
    cache are per client, not per task (FR-182, FR-305).  Every company is
    a different domain, so the concurrency costs no single site anything.

    ``skip_company_ids`` is the resume seam (NFR-401).  A worker that survives
    a restart keeps the companies it already visited in its checkpoint and
    passes them here, so the sweep neither re-walks nor re-counts them.  The
    work list is asked for ``ceiling + len(skip_company_ids)`` rows and the
    skipped companies are dropped afterwards, which keeps the selected set the
    same size it would have been without the skips rather than shrinking it.
    When every selected company is skipped the pass emits its terminal
    ``done`` tick and returns an empty report rather than failing.
