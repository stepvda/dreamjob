"""Campaign planning: which sources, and what to ask each of them (FR-161..166).

Planning is the step between "here is my dream job" and "go and collect".  It
runs in five passes:

0. **Discover** (FR-162) - materialise the *targets* the selected sources will
   be pointed at: one board per (vendor, slug) from the registry, the knowledge
   base and the companies the seeker named, and one EURES item per region x
   sector x period.  Without this pass every company-scoped source was planned
   once with an empty target list and then reported "done, 0 records", which is
   why the first gathering phase retrieved nothing at all.  Discovery is
   deterministic and spends no tokens (see :mod:`dreamjob.pipeline.discovery`).
1. **Select** (FR-161, FR-164) - read the source catalogue and keep only the
   sources whose coverage, terms of service and access method fit this search.
   A Benelux search never plans an Asian job board, and every rejection is kept
   with its reason so the plan screen can explain itself.
2. **Translate** (FR-162) - the LLM turns the composite profile, the directives
   and the dream job model into each surviving source's *native* query form:
   keyword strings and filter parameters for a job board, a board slug for an
   ATS, a sector code for a registry, crawl seeds for a website crawler, search
   URLs for LinkedIn.  Sources are translated in small batches, so a failed
   call costs only its own sources.  When the model is unavailable or the token
   budget is nearly spent, a deterministic query is built from the directives
   instead (NFR-104).
3. **Estimate and persist** (FR-163, FR-166) - pages, duration and cost per
   source, written as ``source_plan_item`` rows that the user reviews, edits or
   excludes before anything is fetched, and that every collected record is
   later linked back to.
4. **Reuse** (FR-342) - the knowledge base is queried and plan items that are
   already covered by fresh data are skipped, with the saving reported.

The LinkedIn network strategy (FR-165) is planned as its own item: first-degree
contacts, people in similar roles and alumni of the same employers and schools,
under an explicit maximum number of profiles and companies.
