"""A test fixture may not reach a campaign plan (FR-161, FR-163, FR-164; C5).

This is the second time unit-test data has been found in the installed
database.  The first was the ``source_catalogue`` rows ``broken_board`` and
``stub_board``: ``sync_catalogue`` writes every adapter in the process-wide
registry (NFR-601), a full unit run has each module's stubs in that registry,
and one ``load_all()`` against the real ``DREAMJOB_DB_PATH`` catalogued them as
real sources.  Those rows are pruned at start-up now and
``tests/unit/conftest.py`` points the whole suite at a scratch file, so the
catalogue cannot be polluted again.

What nobody cleaned up was what the polluted catalogue *produced*: 104
``source_plan_item`` rows naming ``broken_board``, ``stub_board`` and eight
``spine.*`` stubs, spread over 32 campaigns - items a campaign schedules,
cannot run and cannot explain, and 104 of the 538 outcomes the FR-185
dashboard had to account for.  Migration 132 deletes
them; the guard in ``campaigns.insert_plan_item`` is what stops the next ones
being written: a plan item must name a source something knows about - an
implementation, or a catalogue row a person can act on.

The guard cannot use the ten real fixture names as its example, because in a
full unit run those stubs *are* registered adapters in this process - which is
exactly the leak's mechanism, and the reason the guard is the second net and
``conftest`` is the first.
