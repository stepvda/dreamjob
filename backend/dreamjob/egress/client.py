"""The single egress layer for all outbound HTTP (IR-102, FR-182, FR-183).

Nothing in Dream Job calls ``httpx`` directly except this module and the mail
backends.  Routing every request through one place is what makes these
requirements testable:

* **FR-182** - robots.txt compliance *including its stated ``Crawl-delay``*,
  per-domain rate limiting with back-off, one consistent user agent, and a
  response cache with a configurable TTL so repeat campaigns do not re-fetch
  unchanged pages.  Rules that could not be read are *unknown*, not *absent*:
  the fetch is refused with :class:`RobotsUnavailable` and the failure is
  re-tried in minutes, so one bad minute cannot switch robots.txt off for a
  whole domain for a day.
* **FR-183** - every fetched page is stored raw on disk with its URL,
  timestamp and content hash, and registered in ``raw_document`` so that
  extractors can be re-run later (DR-102).
* **IR-102** - retries, logging and metrics live here rather than in each of
  the twenty-odd source adapters.

Four ways a page used to be fetched that had already been fetched (see
``docs/Data_Gathering_Plan.md`` section 4 and item N4; NFR-103 is what they
cost):

1. **The TTL expired and the whole body came back.**  ``etag`` and
   ``last_modified`` were stored and never sent.  Now they are: on expiry the
   request carries ``If-None-Match`` / ``If-Modified-Since``, and a **304**
   keeps the stored body and extends ``expires_at``.  An unchanged 3.6 MB
   Greenhouse board costs 0 bytes instead of 3.6 MB.
2. **Two plan items wanted the same URL at the same time.**  Serial collection
   hid it; domain-parallel collection (N5) would have made it N-1 duplicate
   downloads per shared page.  ``fetch`` now coalesces concurrent GETs of one
   URL onto a single in-flight future.
3. **The same page under a different spelling.**  ``?x=1&y=2`` and ``?y=2&x=1``,
   ``HOST`` and ``host``, ``https://h`` and ``https://h/`` are one resource and
   are now one cache key.  The key is computed *before* any fan-out, so
   coalescing and the cache agree on what "the same URL" means.
4. **A 404 that was probed again on every pass.**  Failures are now
   negative-cached - 404/410 for ``DREAMJOB_NEGATIVE_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS``
   (7 days), 429/5xx for six hours - and non-200 bodies are no longer written
   to the raw-document store at all: a Cloudflare challenge page differing only
   in its Ray ID is not a document (FR-183).

The **fetch ledger** at the bottom of this module is the per-target half of the
same problem (FR-342): ``http_cache`` answers "have we got this URL?", the
ledger answers "when did we last read *this board / this employer / this
query*, and how much did it give us?".  Reuse decided per adapter skipped 3,399
never-read Greenhouse boards the moment one Greenhouse board was read; decided
per target it skips exactly the targets that are still fresh.
