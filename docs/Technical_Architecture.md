## 1. Constraints and what follows from them

The SRS fixes the stack (§2.5, CR-407–CR-410). Everything below is a consequence
of taking those constraints seriously rather than working around them.

| Layer | Fixed choice | What it forces |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | React SPA | Route-level code splitting; the API is the only contract |
| Backend | Python | FastAPI, asyncio, in-process job runner |
| Database | SQLite | WAL mode, **one writer**, SQL confined to a repository layer |
| LLM | DeepSeek | OpenAI-compatible transport, so a local model substitutes without code change |
| Browser | CDP via Playwright | Attach-only; no credential handling anywhere in the codebase |

> **The most consequential constraint is SQLite.** One writer means the job
> runner is in-process and cooperative rather than a worker pool, and it means
> writes are serialised deliberately instead of contended for. That is a
> reasonable trade for a single-node product and it is the assumption to revisit
> first if multi-user concurrency ever becomes real (CR-408 anticipates exactly
> this).

## 3. The five chokepoints

The architecture rests on funnelling five concerns through exactly one place
each. That is what makes the corresponding requirements *enforceable* rather
than aspirational — each is a property of one module, not a convention 219
modules have to remember. Two more funnels were added as the Discover phase
grew: the employer-kind verdict and the company-domain decision.

| Chokepoint | Module | Enforces |
|---|---|---|
| Every SQL statement | `db/repositories/*`, `db/connection.py` | CR-408 portability, FR-344 isolation |
| Every outbound HTTP request | `egress/client.py` | FR-182 robots + rate limits, FR-183 raw capture, IR-102 |
| Every LLM call | `llm/client.py` | NFR-104 budget, NFR-205 injection defence, CR-410 redaction, FR-362 routing, FR-364 audit |
| Every external source | `adapters/base.py` | NFR-601 extensibility, IR-101 terms status |
| Every long-running task | `jobs/runner.py` | FR-185 control, NFR-401 resumability |
| Every employer-kind verdict | `pipeline/employer_resolver.py` | FR-341, NFR-402 no verdict without evidence |
| Every company-domain decision | `pipeline/company_domains.py` | DR-101 identity, NFR-402 provenance |

### 3.1 Persistence — `db/`

```python
read_tx()    # concurrent readers under WAL
write_tx()   # one global lock; SQLite serialises anyway, so queueing
             # in-process turns "database is locked" into an orderly wait
```

Repositories return plain dicts, never cursors. JSON columns encode and decode
at the boundary. Migrations are forward-only `NNN_name.sql` files with a
recorded checksum; editing an applied migration is a warning, not a silent
divergence.

**Schema shape.** 87 logical tables across 34 migrations — 49 seeker-scoped, 37
shared, one migration ledger, and two FTS5 virtual tables — plus a
`usable_contact` view that encodes the objection rule at the database:

- **Private** — carry `job_seeker_id`: profile and versions, conflicts, skills,
  evidence, personas, enrichment findings, composite profile, dream job model,
  directives, campaigns, plan items, opportunities, application packages,
  dispatches, replies, pipeline cards, mock interviews, gap analyses, exports,
  watchlist entries and apply selections.
- **Shared** — the knowledge base, carrying **no** link back to a job seeker:
  companies, company domains and domain candidates, financial years and
  analyses, competitor links, hiring signals, employer-kind verdicts and
  resolution attempts, registry identity, review summaries, vacancies,
  compensation observations, board registry, company seed, embeddings, raw
  documents, events and source catalogue.
- **Restricted** — `contact`, which is shared *except* when collected through
  browser automation, where `shareable = 0`, `owning_campaign_id` is set and
  `retention_until` applies (NFR-303).

Full-text search over companies and vacancies uses FTS5 — `vacancy_fts` is
external-content with write triggers, and `company_fts` is keyed on the
company row id, so a write no longer scans the corpus (NFR-103).

### 3.2 Egress — `egress/client.py`

One async client for all outbound HTTP.

- **robots.txt** parsed and cached per domain; a disallowed fetch raises rather
  than proceeding. A successful parse is cached for a day, a failure for five
  minutes, and an **unreachable** robots file is itself a refusal rather than a
  silent go-ahead. The one narrow exception is a non-crawl probe — a domain
  reachability check or a geocoding lookup — which may be waived explicitly
  rather than by default.
- **Per-domain pacing** with exponential back-off on 429/503 and relief on
  success. Concurrency capped by semaphore (NFR-102 asks for at least 20), with a
  negative-response cache and a fetch ledger so a repeated dead URL is not
  re-fetched.
- **Response cache** with a configurable TTL, so a repeat campaign does not
  re-fetch unchanged pages.
- **Raw capture (FR-183, DR-102):** every response is written to disk under a
  content-hash path and registered in `raw_document`, so extractors can be
  re-run when they improve.

### 3.3 LLM — `llm/client.py`

```python
llm.complete_json(
    "extract.vacancy",              # task id → routing, budget, audit
    system=..., user=...,
    untrusted={"page": html},       # fenced, never concatenated into instructions
    entity_type="vacancy", entity_id=vid,
)
```

- **Routing (FR-362, NFR-306).** Administrator settings beat `.env`; a per-task
  model override beats the cheap/strong split; privacy-sensitive tasks —
  composite profile, tailored CV, motivation document — route to a local
  OpenAI-compatible endpoint when one is configured. Settings are cached 30
  seconds and invalidated on save, so a change on the admin screen takes effect
  on the next call rather than the next restart.
- **Budget (NFR-104).** Checked before each call, debited after. `should_degrade()`
  lets the pipeline shed optional work — speculative openings for low-ranked
  companies first — instead of stopping mid-campaign.
- **Injection defence (NFR-205).** Scraped text is fenced in labelled untrusted
  blocks, fence delimiters neutralised, known injection phrasings annotated
  rather than removed (the model still sees the page, visibly marked). A system
  preamble states the rule. Output is validated before use.
- **Redaction (CR-410, FR-106, FR-127).** Do-not-disclose fields and
  special-category data are stripped before anything leaves the machine.
- **Audit (FR-364).** Task, template, version, model, provider, tokens, cost,
  latency and the related record are written to `llm_call`, with a scheduled
  redaction sweep.
- **Embeddings (FR-341).** `llm.embed()` writes one content-hash-keyed vector per
  entity into `embedding`, skipping unchanged content; nearest-neighbour search
  is pure-Python cosine, so the feature needs no vector database. It is built and
  backfilled by `scripts/build_semantic_index.py` but not yet consulted by
  scoring or the API.

Prompts are versioned `.md` templates with a metadata header (NFR-602); the
version travels into `llm_call.prompt_version`, so a regression in generated
output can be tied to the prompt revision that caused it. There are **24
templates**, and the planner asks the cheap model first and escalates to the
strong model only when the first call fails to produce a usable plan.

### 3.4 Adapters — `adapters/base.py`

Four methods, and the pipeline calls nothing else:

```
plan(directives, composite, caps) → [PlanItem]      native query form
fetch(item)                       → [RawRecord]     through EgressClient
parse(raw)                        → [dict]          deterministic, LLM fallback
normalise(parsed, raw)            → NormalisedRecord knowledge-base columns
```

Each adapter declares coverage, capabilities, rate limit, cost and
terms-of-service status; `sync_catalogue()` writes that into `source_catalogue`
at boot, where the planner reads it (FR-161, FR-164) and the administrator can
override it (FR-363).

**29 adapters:** 9 ATS · 9 job boards · 5 registries · 1 directory · 1 website
crawler · 3 news/events · 1 compensation. Two bulk register importers
(`kbo_bulk.py`, `companies_house_bulk.py`) and the board registry deliberately
sit beside the contract rather than inside it: they seed the shared knowledge
base from an operator-run file, they do not collect per-campaign.

Extraction prefers JSON-LD `JobPosting` where present, then deterministic
selectors, then LLM extraction. Success rate is tracked per adapter so layout
breakage surfaces within one campaign (NFR-403), and a register's explicit "no"
is recorded as an answer rather than treated as a failure.

### 3.5 Jobs — `jobs/runner.py`

In-process asyncio. Each job checkpoints after every unit of work, so a crash
loses at most the page in flight (NFR-401). `checkpoint_barrier()` is where a
worker yields and honours pause, cancel and per-target skip. On boot, jobs left
running by a restart are marked resumable.

Deliberately not a broker: a broker buys nothing on a single node and breaks the
one-writer invariant.

## 4. Security

| Concern | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| Data at rest (NFR-201) | AES-256-GCM, keys derived per job seeker by HKDF from one master key. Credentials, secrets, TOTP material, sealed profile sections and package generation notes are field-encrypted. Deleting a job seeker makes their ciphertext unreadable even if a copy survives. |
| Passwords (NFR-202) | Argon2id (PBKDF2-SHA256 fallback), with a policy requiring three of four character classes |
| MFA (NFR-202) | TOTP, secret stored encrypted, fail-closed if the envelope cannot be decrypted |
| Sessions (NFR-202) | Random token; only the HMAC is stored; bound to a UA+IP fingerprint and re-checked per request; revoked on password change, admin reset and suspension |
| Accounts (FR-108) | First account is admin; create/suspend/reset/delete, with a last-active-administrator guard and a self-guard |
| Third-party credentials (NFR-203) | **Never stored.** Browser automation attaches to a session the user owns |
| Mail tokens (NFR-204) | Encrypted, scoped to send + bounce-read, revocable from the UI |
| Prompt injection (NFR-205) | Content isolation, instruction/data separation, output validation |
| Leakage (NFR-206) | Generated documents scanned against the job seeker's own provenance set |
| Objections (NFR-302) | Enforced in a `usable_contact` view, not only in the interface |
| Audit (NFR-702) | Append-only trail of who approved and sent what, with the versions used |

**Known gaps**, stated rather than glossed: passkeys are not implemented (the
password+MFA branch is); a `webauthn_credentials` column exists in the initial
schema but no code path reads or writes it. The SQLite file itself is not
encrypted, so whole-database confidentiality rests on disk encryption —
SQLCipher would add a dependency.

---

## 5. Frontend

**React 18 + Vite + react-router-dom v7.** Five dependencies in total: react,
react-dom, react-router-dom, vite, @vitejs/plugin-react. No UI kit, no chart
library, no date library, no state manager — charts are inline SVG, icons are
inline SVG, state is hooks plus one session context.

The shell presents the product as **three steps plus Advanced**: Start here,
1·Your profile, 2·Opportunities, 3·Apply, Follow up, with every deeper screen —
directives, campaigns, companies, intelligence, networking, monitoring, mail,
admin — folded under one Advanced disclosure so a first-time user meets the
spine, not the whole surface.

**Route-level code splitting.** 24 lazy page chunks (26 async chunks including
the workflow map and the employer panel) behind a shared shell:

```
initial   348 KB  (110 KB gzip)  shell + design system + router
per page  7–74 KB (3–20 KB gzip) loaded on navigation
```

Down from 858 KB unsplit — the administration area and the PDF previews no
longer load before the profile page can paint (NFR-101).

**Design system.** One `app.css` of tokens and layout, one `theme.css` that
re-points the tokens to the spectrum palette. Colour is structural: each of the
five journey phases owns a hue, so a violet screen is always about the profile
and an amber one is always about applying.

All six hues verified at **WCAG AA (≥4.5:1)** for small text against both the
surface and their own tint, in light and dark:

```
LIGHT        on white   on tint        DARK       on surface   on tint
Profile        5.37       4.63         Profile       6.39        5.92
Plan           5.19       4.56         Plan          7.10        6.25
Discover       5.13       4.51         Discover      8.40        6.99
Apply          5.05       4.52         Apply         8.51        7.49
Follow up      5.25       4.55         Follow up     7.19        6.63
```

Body text stays near-neutral; colour carries identity and state and never has to
be read. Speculative openings hold a hue outside all five phases, so FR-263
survives on colour alone. `prefers-reduced-motion` disables animation.

**Help is structural, not optional.** All copy lives in `help/content.js` — 21
screen entries and 142 glossary terms — so it is reviewable as a whole and
translatable as a unit (NFR-501). A screen cannot ship without help because the
drawer resolves its content from the route. **305 inline concept tips** across
the screens; `?` opens the panel anywhere.

---

## 6. Deployment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
python3 -m dreamjob.security.crypto --generate-key   # master key + session secret
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd frontend && npm install && cd ..
./scripts/dev.sh                       # API :8000, SPA :5173 with /api proxied
```

Production is the same process serving the built SPA from `frontend/dist`.
Migrations run at startup. The **monitoring scheduler autostarts inside the API
process at boot** (controlled by `DREAMJOB_SCHEDULER_ENABLED`, with
`DREAMJOB_SCHEDULER_AUTOSTART` as an override) and runs eight tasks — reply and
bounce polling, watchlist rechecks, automatic company enrichment, follow-ups,
outcome learning, the weekly digest, contact retention and LLM log redaction.
`--once` remains available from an external cron, and any task can be stopped,
started or triggered from the monitoring screen.

`scripts/browser.sh` launches a Chromium-based browser with a remote debugging
port and a dedicated profile, for the collection steps that need a logged-in
session. A Firefox profile can be driven through a Playwright persistent context
instead, using the same session contract.

```

Every stage persists its artefacts and can be re-run independently (NFR-603).
The resolution ladders run before profiling so a posting is attributed to the
right company — and an agency or an undisclosed employer is labelled, not
profiled as if it were the client.

---

## 8. Performance

| Requirement | Approach |
|---|---|
| NFR-101 interactive views < 2s at p95 | 144 indexes; FTS5 for search; deterministic pre-rank avoids an LLM call per row; lazy routes keep first paint small |
| NFR-102 ≥20 concurrent HTTP workers, serialised writes | Semaphore-bounded async egress; one global write lock under WAL |
| NFR-103 typical campaign < 4 hours | Caps bound the work; ATS JSON is cheap; **not yet measured against a real campaign** |
| NFR-104 bounded LLM spend | Pre-flight check, post-call debit, graceful degradation |
| CR-406 browser automation is slow | Accepted by design: tens to low hundreds of targets, announced up front |

---

## 9. Testing

**1,725 tests in the offline suite, 51,165 lines across 94 files.** Each runs
against a migrated temporary database and without network access; LLM and HTTP
paths are stubbed or skipped, and the network and load tests are deselected
(`-m 'not llm and not load'`). A Playwright e2e harness and persona generator
live under `tests/e2e` for the flows that need a browser.

The tests worth naming are the ones that encode a requirement rather than a
function:

- A private table added by a **later migration** is still exported and erased
  (FR-108) — coverage is derived from the live schema, so a new table cannot be
  silently missed.
- Manual ranking survives recalculation (FR-284).
- A second job seeker's data appears nowhere in an export (FR-463).
- A redirection proposal naming an unseen segment is dropped, and effects are
  recomputed from the stored figures (§9.3 of the FDD).
- A professional history in a regulated domain is **not** stripped as
  special-category data, and a personal assertion **is** (FR-127).
- Administrator model settings actually change the routing decision (FR-362).
- Browser automation persists no cookie or token (NFR-203).
- An employer-kind verdict is never delivered without evidence, and a website
  rung's quotation is verified verbatim against the page (FR-341).
- A company register's explicit "no match" is recorded as an answer, not raised
  as a failure (FR-403).
- The last active administrator cannot be suspended or deleted (FR-108).
- A consistency override is persisted and reaches dispatch; a leak and an
  objected contact are not overridable (FR-322, NFR-206).

**Verified end-to-end against the real source documents**: LinkedIn export and
CV parsed and merged, 18 conflicts surfaced, photo extracted, 52 skills
normalised, and the dream-job model generated through the live DeepSeek API.

## 10. Extension points

| To add | Do this | Touching |
|---|---|---|
| A job board, registry or compensation source | Subclass `SourceAdapter`, `@register_adapter` | One file |
| An events or news source | Subclass the radar/news adapter, `@register_adapter` | One file |
| A jurisdiction's filings | A registry adapter + extractor mapping | Two files |
| A CV template | A module under `documents/templates/` | One file |
| A mail backend | Implement `MailBackend` | One file |
| A calendar provider | Implement the client and wire the OAuth exchange | One file |
| A language | Add to the prompt templates and `help/content.js` | Content only |
| A local model | Set `DREAMJOB_LOCAL_LLM_*` and list the task groups | Configuration |
| Semantic search | Set `DREAMJOB_EMBEDDINGS_*` and run `scripts/build_semantic_index.py` | Config + script |
| A scheduler task | Add a `Task` with an interval to `DEFAULT_TASKS` | `monitoring/scheduler.py` |
| A bulk employer import | An operator script against the shared knowledge base | One script |
| An account lifecycle action | Add to `auth_service` behind `current_admin` | Service + router |
| PostgreSQL | Replace `db/connection.py` and the repository bodies | The layer built for it |

## 11. Requirement traceability

**156 of 157 requirements (99%)** are cited in the implementation — 103/104
Must, 44/44 Should, 9/9 Could. Regenerate the matrix with:

```bash
python3 scripts/traceability.py
```

The one uncited requirement is the DPIA itself (NFR-304), a document rather than
a code path. The known limitations are listed in the Functional Design, §12.
