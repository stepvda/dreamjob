"""Storage hygiene for the raw-document store (FR-183, DR-102, NFR-103).

The egress layer stores every fetched body once, keyed by content hash, and
registers it in ``raw_document`` so extractors can be re-run later (FR-183,
DR-102).  Nothing ever removed one.  A weekly revalidation of ~6,900 ATS boards
changes a few hundred of them, and every changed board leaves the *previous*
body behind: ~160 MB a week, ~8 GB a year, referenced by no provenance row, no
vacancy and no live cache entry (docs/Data_Gathering_Plan.md section 4, L2, and
section 5.2 item N7).

A document is an orphan when all four of these hold:

* it is older than the retention window (30 days by default) - so a document a
  running campaign has just fetched is never a candidate;
* no ``provenance`` row points at it - which is the FR-166 trail from a
  collected record back to the page it came from;
* no ``vacancy`` and no ``compensation_observation`` row points at it directly;
* no *unexpired* ``http_cache`` entry is serving its file as a cached body -
  deleting the file underneath a live cache entry would turn a cache hit into a
  silent miss.

The last check is done here rather than in SQL because ``http_cache.body_path``
holds an absolute path while ``raw_document.storage_path`` is relative to the
data directory; the file name is the content hash, which is what the two have
in common and what makes the comparison exact.
